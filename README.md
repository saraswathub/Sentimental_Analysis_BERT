Sentimental Analysis using BERT


Sentiment analysis using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a powerful approach for understanding the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed in text. BERT is a pre-trained transformer model that has achieved state-of-the-art results on various NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis.


Python libraries:

    transformers: Provides pre-trained BERT models and tokenizers.

    torch: PyTorch, the deep learning framework used by the transformers library.

    pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

    numpy: For numerical computations.

    scikit-learn: For evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc.
